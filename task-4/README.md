# Task 4 - Trends

With the increase in AI availability and decrease in pricing, I saw a surge of usage especially on startup companies. Since enterprise applications value stablity over the shiny new thing, it got to them slowly. Code generation is not perfect but the main purpose is to save time and effort by developers when google or stackoverflow is not enough when looking for answers.

Recent news on AI like Claude 3.7, GPT-4.1, or even DeepSeek means AI tools are still becoming more intelligent and the enterprise world should use these tools not only for developers but inside the applications that they are developing themeselves. I know some companies already have their own on-premise AI agents to maximize security and still benefit from all the advantages AI provide.

I have been mainly using ChatGPT to study how to I can "control" it by precisely constructing the context it needs to provide me, more or less, the perfect response to what I need. Not only in helping me with developing apps but also integrating the AI to the app itself. I can use it to give me a tailored response if I give it personalized context so the AI feels more connected to the user.

I don't believe AI is the end all, be all for us developers. But it does make our lives and work output better especially if we use it properly.
