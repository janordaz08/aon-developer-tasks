# Task 5 - Describe Software that Delivers User Value

On my most recent tenure, we have been creating a healthcare website where users can search and select the doctor they want, select the date and time and book an appointment with that doctor. 

The most critical aspect in creating value for the user is how we integrate the flow closely to the user, making the connection to them and personalizing the whole experience as much as possible for them. Communicating the whole flow, either by SMS, Email, WhatsApp or however we can. Having a reply to their concerns, even if it is automated really makes a whole difference compared to having no replies at all. This is where AI actually helps. If we can answer their concerns with personalized context, the experience can be much greater.

Of course there are the technical aspects of the website as well, user-friendly experience, mobile-friendliness, snapiness of the website, how quickly I can navigate the pages, all that stuff. All in all, it all boils down to providing the best user-experience a user can have in successfully creating value for the user.
