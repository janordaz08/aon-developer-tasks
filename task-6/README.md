# Task 6 - Your Values

The most important core value in being in a team is communication, being proactive generally, and being accountable:

1. Communicating and asking for help if you get stuck on problem might save more time rather than figuring it out on your own. It prevents misunderstandings and makes sure that issues are caught early.

2. Being proactive just doesn't mean you're not waiting for instructions before you do anything, but actively seeking to understand requiements, looking for potential risks/defect and helping othes before they ask.

3. I believe in taking full responsibility for my actions. Not only in owning successes but fully accepting mistakes, explaining how it happened and learning from them.
